## üß† Programming Exercises

### 1. Factorial using Function
Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a function.

### 2. Test Divisibility by 3 and 4
Write a function `test_divisibility_by_3_4` which checks divisibility:
- Return `0` if divisible by both 3 and 4
- Return `1` if divisible by 3 only
- Return `2` if divisible by 4 only
- Return `-1` if divisible by neither

### 3. Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference
Demonstrate both pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in Rust using separate functions.

### 4. Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
Write a function `calculate_area_perimeter(x, y)` that returns a tuple `(area, perimeter)`.

### 5. Array of Squares
Create a function `arr_square()` that returns an array of squares of integers.

### 6. Recursive Fibonacci
Write a recursive function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the `n`th term in the Fibonacci sequence.

---

### 7. Creating a String
Write a program to create a `String` object in Rust.

### 8. String Manipulation using Core Methods
Demonstrate usage of:
- `str.capacity()`
- `str.contains("sub_str")`
- `str.replace(replace_from, replace_to)`
- `str.trim()`

### 9. Tokenize and Iterate Over a String
Split a string into tokens (words) and iterate over them using `.split_whitespace()`.

### 10. Push a String into Another String
Append one string to another using `push_str()`.

### 11. Words Starting with ‚Äúc‚Äù
Write a function that:
- Finds all words starting with **‚Äúc‚Äù**
- Concatenates them
- Returns the resulting string
